## Installation
This package uses dotnet 8.

### From Nuget
Simply run the following commands
```shell
dotnet package add NDJH.Hypixel.API
```
If you want DI support run:
```shell
dotnet package add NDJH.Hypixel.API.DependencyInjection
```

### From Source


## Configuration

#### Using Dependency Injection

To utilize dependency injection in your project, ensure that you install the `NDJH.Hpixel.API.DependencyInjection`
package first. This package enables automatic dependency injection of Hypixel API services.

You'll have to add a `Hypixel` section to your application's configuration file as demonstrated below:

```json
{
  "Hypixel": {
    "BaseUrl": "",
    "ApiKey": ""
  }
}
```

**Note:** It's not necessary to include a base URL in your configuration. The program will automatically read the
configuration and load it into your application.
The configuration will automatically be read and loaded into your application.

The `BaseUrl` is the base URL for Hypixel API services and `ApiKey` is your personal API key that authorizes you to
access the Hypixel API services.

Ensure that this configuration file is located in the root of your project unless your application's logic specifies a
different location.

## Examples

### DI
Make sure you either inject `IHypixelWrapper` or the "service" you want such as `ISkyBlock`.
```csharp
public class YourClass(ISkyBlock _skyBlock, IHypixelWrapper _hypixel) 
{
    public Task YourMethod()
    {
        // Getting SkyBlock collections via SkyBlock Service
        var skyBlockCollections = await _skyblock.GetCollectionsAsync();
        
        // You can now access all of the current collections data via the variable
        
        // Getting SkyBlock Collections From the HypixelWrapper
        var skyBlockCollections2 = await _hypixel.SkyBlock.GetCollectionsAsync();
        
        
    }
    
}
```
